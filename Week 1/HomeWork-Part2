/*1-Declare a variable x and initialize it with an integer */

let x = 9

/*2-How do you round the number 7.25, to the nearest integer?*/

let x = 7.25

/*3-Create a array called colors with the strings red, green and blue inside */

let color ['red','green','blue'];

/*4-How can you find the length of the string you just created?*/

/*5-Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type */

/*7-Write a program to answer the following questions:

Can you store multiple types in an array? Numbers and strings?
Can you compare inifities? (Not in Eyad's world) - does 6/0 == 10/0? How can you test this? */
